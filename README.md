In this tutorial, you will learn how to write your own Django Custom Template Tags and Filters. There are lots of built-in template tags and filters in Django. But sometimes these tags are of no use or we need more functionality to do. For such a situation we create our own tags and filters.

### Setup
1. Create a folder and put all the files inside it.
2. Create a virtual environtment - `virtualenv env`
3. Activate VirtualENV - `source env/bin/activate`
4. Run requirements.txt - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Application - `python3 manage.py runserver`
6. Go to - http://localhost:8000/
